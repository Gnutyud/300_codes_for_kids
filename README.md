I create an quiz app for my practice purpose. Because I am learning Javascript so my idea is make a 	
JavaScript Quiz based on the challenges was wrote in Github from https://github.com/yeungon/In-JavaScript-we-trust.
###### What's up?
You can test your JavaScript skills with this Quiz. The test is not official, it's just a nice way to see how much you know, or don't know, about JavaScript.
Have fun practicing with the quiz !!!
